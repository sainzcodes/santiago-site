# ⚠️ CRITICAL SECURITY WARNING

## Never Share These Keys:

### 🔴 Global API Key
- **Access Level**: FULL account access
- **Risk**: Complete control over ALL your domains
- **Can**: Delete zones, change DNS, modify billing
- **Recovery**: Must regenerate, breaking all integrations

### 🔴 Origin CA Key  
- **Access Level**: SSL certificate generation
- **Risk**: Can create certificates for any domain
- **Can**: Issue trusted certificates
- **Recovery**: Complex certificate revocation process

## ✅ Safe Alternative: Scoped API Token

Instead, create a LIMITED token with only needed permissions:
- ✅ Zone:Read (view settings)
- ✅ Page Rules:Edit (manage rules)
- ✅ Limited to santiagosainz.com only
